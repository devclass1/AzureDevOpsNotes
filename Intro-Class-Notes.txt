What is the roles in DevOps?

DevOps:

Culture and Collaboration: DevOps is a cultural and organizational approach that aims to bridge the gap between development and operations teams. It promotes collaboration, shared responsibilities, and continuous communication.
Continuous Integration and Deployment: DevOps focuses on automating the software delivery process through continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This enables frequent and reliable software releases.
Infrastructure as Code: DevOps emphasizes the use of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools to provision and manage infrastructure. This allows for consistent and repeatable environments and simplifies configuration management.
Monitoring and Feedback Loop: DevOps incorporates monitoring tools and practices to collect real-time data on system performance and user behavior. This feedback loop helps identify issues and drive continuous improvement.
Shift-Left Testing: DevOps promotes early and continuous testing throughout the software development lifecycle. Testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, allowing for faster feedback and bug detection.
DevOps Tools: DevOps utilizes a wide range of tools for automation, configuration management, orchestration, and monitoring. Examples include Jenkins, GitLab, Docker, Kubernetes, and various cloud services.
